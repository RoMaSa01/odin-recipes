    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>
      Roasted broccoli is a simple and delicious way to prepare this vegetable.
      Roasting broccoli in the oven makes it tender on the inside and crispy on
      the outside, with a slightly roasted and sweet flavor. Roasted broccoli is
      a perfect accompaniment to many dishes, such as meat, fish, pasta or
      salads. It can also be eaten alone, with a little lemon and Parmesan
      cheese, or with your favorite sauce.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>500 g fresh broccoli</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>Juice and zest of half a lemon</li>
      <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 220ÂºC and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the broccoli into small florets and wash them well. Dry them with
        kitchen paper or a clean cloth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the
        broccoli and stir well so that it is well impregnated with the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the broccoli on the baking sheet, leaving space between the
        florets. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender and
        golden brown around the edges. Halfway through baking, turn the broccoli
        over so that it is done on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the broccoli from the oven and sprinkle with the lemon juice and
        zest. If you like, sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on top. Serve hot
        or warm, on its own or with your favorite dish.
      </li>
