      Homemade meat lasagna is a traditional and delicious dish that is loved by
      children and adults alike. It consists of layers of pasta filled with a

      is baked until golden brown and au gratin, and served hot or warm. It is
      an ideal dish to share with family or friends, and can be accompanied by a
      green salad or garlic bread.

      <li>1 heaped teaspoon of dried oregano (or Provençal herbs)</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper (according to taste)</li>
      <li>12 sheets of lasagna or lasagna Garofalo</li>
      <li>125 g all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>125 g butter</li>
      <li>1 liter of whole milk</li>
      <li>A pinch of nutmeg (about 4 g)</li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the meat stuffing, put a large pan on the fire with the olive
        oil and fry the bacon or bacon cut into small pieces until it is golden
        brown. Add the minced meat and season to taste. Cook over high heat,
        stirring from time to time, until it loses its pink color and releases
        its juices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, chop the peppers, carrots, onions and garlic into small
        pieces. Add them to the casserole with the meat and lower the heat. Cook
        for about 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables
        are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the natural tomato, the white wine and the dried oregano. Mix well
        and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cover the casserole. Cook for an
        hour and a half, uncovering the casserole for the last 30 minutes so
        that the sauce reduces. The meat should be tender, but not too shredded,
        and the sauce should be thick. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if
        necessary. Reserve the meat filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the béchamel sauce, put the milk in a saucepan with the bay
        leaf. Heat it until it starts to boil, turn off the heat and let it
        infuse. In another saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and add
        the flour. Stir with a whisk until you obtain a homogeneous paste
        without lumps. Cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly, so that the
        flour is slightly toasted and loses its raw taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bay leaf from the milk and add it little by little to the
        saucepan with the butter and flour, stirring constantly with the whisk.
        Cook over medium-low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, until the béchamel
        sauce is very thick and smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste and grate a
        little nutmeg. Add the Parmesan cheese and the egg yolks and mix well.
        Reserve the béchamel sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Grease a large baking dish with a little
        olive oil. Cook the lasagna sheets in a pot with boiling water and salt
        for about 20 seconds, just to soften them, and transfer them to a bowl
        with cold water. Drain the lasagna sheets and dry them with kitchen
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put a layer of pasta in the base of the baking dish. Cover with a layer
        of meat filling, and then with a layer of bechamel sauce. Repeat the
        process until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of
        pasta and bechamel sauce. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the
        lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the lasagna for about 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown and
        bubbly. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes. Cut the
        lasagna into squares and let it rest for another 10 minutes before
        serving. This way the layers hold together better and it cools a little
        faster.
