        Place carrots in a large pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a
        boil and reduce the heat. Cover the pot and cook the carrots until
        tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the water and transfer the carrots
        to a bowl.

        Melt the butter in the same saucepan over low heat. Add the brown sugar,
        salt and pepper and stir until dissolved. Add the carrots to the pot and
        stir well to coat them in the butter and sugar mixture. Cook and stir
        until the carrots are hot and completely glazed, 1 to 3 minutes more.

        If desired, sprinkle a little chopped fresh parsley on top of the
        carrots. Serve hot or warm, on its own or with your favorite dish.
